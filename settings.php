/**
 * Admin settings for the block_nvq_matrix plugin.
 *
 * Deliberately small. Two candidate settings were ruled out as
 * redundant with existing Moodle admin UI rather than built here:
 * the notification task's polling interval (already editable per-task
 * via Site administration -> Server -> Scheduled tasks - a second
 * setting here would just be two places to change the same thing) and
 * the popup/email channel split (already user-configurable via each
 * person's own Notification preferences once a message provider is
 * registered, which 'assessorsubmission' is). The one setting here
 * (renotifyonedit) has no existing Moodle equivalent.
 *
 * A second setting, "migrationmode", briefly existed here (v26.6.17 -
 * v26.6.20) to gate backdatable audit-trail timestamps behind a
 * site-wide toggle. Removed again in v26.6.21 - client decision
 * (2026-09-08): simplified back to a flat rule with no setting or
 * gating at all - see matrix_data::resolve_archivedtime()'s own
 * docblock.
