/**
 * AJAX endpoint for PERMANENTLY deleting an archived student's NVQ matrix
 * data for a specific course - grades, sampling records, unit comments,
 * final status, and their evidence comments/types.
 *
 * Accepts a POST with studentid, courseid. Gated on the new
 * block/nvq_matrix:deletearchived capability, deliberately separate from
 * :viewall - being able to SEE the archived list doesn't mean being
 * allowed to permanently destroy data from it. Independently re-verifies
 * the target is genuinely archived (not actively enrolled) regardless of
 * who holds the capability, since this action is irreversible and this
 * plugin has already been burned once by scoping bugs in this exact
 * area (v26.5.3-v26.5.6) - never trust a client-supplied studentid/
 * courseid pair without re-checking server-side.
 *
